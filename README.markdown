# OneClick Installer #

## What is OneClick? ##

If you are used to installing applications on your site, you know what a pain 
it can be. Downloading a Zip Archive, unzipping it on your computer, and 
uploading it to your site via a FTP client can take up to 30 minutes! 

Autoinstallers can also cause problems and not install the latest version
of the software. If you have ever installed software via an autoinstaller, 
then had to upgrade it, chances are you had some problems.

The solution to this problem is OneClick. OneClick is a single PHP file
that you upload to your server via FTP or other method. Since it's only 
one file, it takes only a fraction of the time required to upload an
entire directory. 


## For users ##

OneClick is avaliable as a download file. For a list of avaliable files,
check [here][1]. More files will be avaliable after development of this
project is completed.

## For developers ##

Developing a OneClick installer is easy and can be done in less than an hour.
OneClick takes the hard work out, so you only need to write to PHP code
and maybe a CSS file - all JavaScript is already written. Check [here][2]
to get started.
